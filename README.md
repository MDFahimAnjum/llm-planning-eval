  - Experimental setup with third-party resources 
  - Data and preprocessing
  - Code for framework and implementation
  - Scripts for intrinsic and end-to-end evaluation

## 1 Installation

Please run the following commands to create a conda environment:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate llm-planning
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
conda install cudatoolkit==11.8.0
```
You may also create two additional folders to avoid potential OS errors:
```sh
mkdir log
mkdir results
```

## 2 Experimental Setup

To run our text-to-SQL parsing experiments, we need to set up some third-party resources.

1. Download the original Spider dataset from this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1TqleXec_OykOYFREKKtschzY29dUcVAQ).

2. Clone the Spider evaluation code from this GitHub repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/taoyds/test-suite-sql-eval.git
```

3. Download the original Bird dataset from this [website](https://bird-bench.github.io/) and the [evaluation code](https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/blob/3c1890d16b775a449ce77736c146adde6dafd45c/bird/llm/src/evaluation.py). Then, reorganize the resources in a folder:
```
├───  bird-sql
│    ├───  databases
│        ├───  ...
│    ├───  dev
│        ├───  ...
│    ├───  train
│        ├───  ...
│    ├───  evaluation.py
```
Note that we merge all train/dev databases into a single `databases` folder, instead of under the `dev` or `train` folder as in the original distribution.

Finally, we put all the directories in parallel:
```
├───  bird-sql
│    ├───  ...
├───  llm-planning-eval
│    ├───  ...
├───  spider
│    ├───  ...
├───  test-suite-sql-eval
│    ├───  ...
```

## 3 Data and Preprocessing

You can find all our preprocessed data at this [link](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chen_8336_buckeyemail_osu_edu/ETFggRmzpqpOlbP1Sk7_qYcBtXe-VQaam-ERsOeDwQCryA?e=2UfJuM) and unzip it inside this repository.
```
├───  llm-planning-eval
│    ├───  data
│        ├───  ...
│    ├───  evaluation_configs
│        ├───  ...
│    ├───  ...
```

To preprocess text-to-SQL datasets by yourself, you may refer to the example commands in `scripts/preproc/`. It may take some time depending on how fast your machine can process (large) databases.

For GSM8K, we simply extracted the numerical answers at the end of each annotated solution without any other preprocessing.

## 4 Evaluation

We include example scripts for all our experiments in `scripts/`. The LoRA weights of our fine-tuned LLMs can be accessed [here](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/chen_8336_buckeyemail_osu_edu/Et4r77yq4WJIjaSHfh-D1mEBZDpGA69KWvQZqizBD7_tBQ?e=RcHN5S).

#### Extension to Other LLMs
If you would like to extend our framework to other LLMs, you may implement a new generator/evaluator class or a new planning method under the corresponding directories and import them in the functions `select_models`/`select_method`. You may start your implementation by copying one of the provided source code files and modify the classes/funtions accordingly.
